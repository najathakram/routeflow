# Lessons Learned — RouteFlow

> Generalizable rules this project has paid for. **Read this at the start of every major task,
> implementation, or bug fix** (alongside the code map) and cite entry ids when one changes your
> approach. **After every bug fix, append an entry** — Symptom / Root cause / **Lesson** / Guard —
> and bump [`_meta.json`](_meta.json); Gate 3 of [`../hooks/stop.mjs`](../hooks/stop.mjs) blocks
> fix-shaped turns that don't (a lesson-free fix bumps `_meta.json.updatedAt` to acknowledge).
> Caps: ≤ 40 active entries / ~25 KB — compact to [`ARCHIVE.md`](ARCHIVE.md). Maintained by the
> `lessons-learned` skill. Blameless; **never client names/slugs/document numbers** — the repo
> goes public briefly for CI.

## process

### L-026 · 2026-09-01 · process

- **Symptom:** an approved fix spec instructed editing a root manifest field "because it pins three
  of the five modules". It pinned none of them; following the instruction would have ADDED three
  pins the scope never asked for.
- **Root cause:** the spec was written from an audit summary rather than from the manifests. Two
  further claims in the same five-line item were also wrong — one module was pinned _ahead_ of the
  framework's bundled version (the fix was a downgrade, not a catch-up), and a command it presented
  as a one-liner only accepts an interactive prompt.
- **Lesson:** **A spec's factual claims about a file are a hypothesis, not evidence — read the file
  before editing it, and report the correction rather than quietly conforming or quietly diverging.**
- **Guard:** none — judgment. A spec item naming a specific file + field is a cue to open that file
  first.

### L-027 · 2026-09-01 · process

- **Symptom:** with several sessions running in git worktrees, a repo-file gate was about to be
  satisfied by writing into a _different_ session's working tree — surfacing later as a mystery diff
  in someone else's PR.
- **Root cause:** worktrees are nested inside the main checkout, and hooks resolve their paths
  against that main checkout, not the worktree the session is working in. Whatever branch the shared
  checkout happens to be parked on is the file the gate points at.
- **Lesson:** **Never satisfy a gate by writing into whatever tree the hook happens to run from —
  defer the write to your own worktree and say plainly why. Keep the shared checkout on the
  integration branch; it is the only sane resting state for a tree that hooks resolve against.**
- **Guard:** none — judgment. A gate demanding a repo file while you work in a worktree is the cue
  to check which tree that path actually lands in.

### L-007 · 2026-08-31 · process · #562

- **Symptom:** an operator kept losing scans after the fix for exactly that had shipped.
- **Root cause:** the fix targeted the native scanner while every client runs the mobile **web**
  build — the reporter never received it.
- **Lesson:** **Before fixing a platform-variant bug, establish which variant the reporter
  actually uses; fix that one first.**
- **Guard:** login-screen build stamp makes "which build is that device on?" answerable.

### L-006 · 2026-08-23 · process · #412

- **Symptom:** every session paid ~38K tokens just to read the code map's `_meta.json`.
- **Root cause:** its `notes` field accumulated history (~90K chars) because nothing bounded it.
- **Lesson:** **Any always-read field or file needs a hard cap and an overflow home — latest in
  the hot path, history in a changelog.**
- **Guard:** code-map CHANGELOG convention; this register's own caps.

### L-004 · 2026-08-24 · process

- **Symptom:** autonomous sessions stalled retrying merges and visibility flips.
- **Root cause:** the auto-mode permission classifier blocks `gh pr merge`, visibility flips,
  and prod-DB commands while the owner is away.
- **Lesson:** **One clean attempt at a blocked command, then reorganize the work: open
  hook-verified PRs plus a written owner runbook — never retry or route around a block.**
- **Guard:** none — judgment.

### L-005 · 2026-08-20 · process

- **Symptom:** the whole working session died mid-batch and needed manual repair.
- **Root cause:** 14 concurrent background agents (~500 MB each) saturated the 14-core/32 GB
  box — resource starvation, not an app fault.
- **Lesson:** **Cap background agents at 4 and run bigger batches in waves; have every agent
  append results incrementally so a hard kill loses nothing.**
- **Guard:** standing hard rule (memory), workflow concurrency defaults.

### L-003 · 2026-08-20 · process · #367–#376

- **Symptom:** five consecutive Railway deploys failed with "Snapshot code → repository not
  found".
- **Root cause:** flipping the repo private in the same breath as the merge landed inside
  Railway's snapshot window, invalidating the clone token mid-snapshot.
- **Lesson:** **After a merge, wait until the deploy reaches `BUILDING` (never
  `INITIALIZING`) before flipping private — and the flip stays a `finally`.**
- **Guard:** the `until … BUILDING|DEPLOYING|SUCCESS` loop in CLAUDE.md's deploy flow.

### L-002 · 2026-08-15 · process · #342

- **Symptom:** the repo sat PUBLIC for ~24 hours after a docs-only PR.
- **Root cause:** the private flip was gated on a CI watcher; docs-only changes trigger no CI
  run, so the watcher polled an empty run id forever and the flip step never ran.
- **Lesson:** **A safety-critical step fires on a bound (deadline), never solely on a success
  signal — and verify the end state directly (`gh repo view --json visibility`).**
- **Guard:** deploy-flow rule in CLAUDE.md; empty-id guard before any poll loop.

### L-001 · 2026-07-30 · process

- **Symptom:** a batch started on the previous batch's already-merged branch; the eventual PR
  base was misleading.
- **Root cause:** the pre-push hook blocks branch deletion, so merged branches linger checked
  out between sessions.
- **Lesson:** **Cut a fresh branch off master before any batch/pipeline run — check with
  `git rev-list --left-right --count master...HEAD` first.**
- **Guard:** none — judgment (pipeline step 0).

### L-008 · 2026-07 · process

- **Symptom:** production login broke after a commit titled as API-only security work.
- **Root cause:** a web-middleware change rode along in a commit scoped and reviewed as API-only.
- **Lesson:** **Never edit a layer outside the batch's stated scope — surface it and ask; a
  commit title must name every layer it touches.**
- **Guard:** none — judgment.

## tooling

### L-032 · 2026-09-01 · tooling

- **Symptom:** forcing a transitive past a parent's exact pin failed twice, each time silently.
  First: adding the root `overrides` pin and regenerating with `--package-lock-only` left the
  hoisted entry on the OLD version — a no-op fix for a no-op fix. Then: deleting just that one lock
  entry and regenerating DID move it, and **broke every file upload in the process**, with no error
  anywhere — requests returned 201 and the file was simply absent.
- **Root cause:** two distinct properties of npm, both invisible in a green build. (1) An override
  applies only when npm **resolves** an edge; `--package-lock-only` keeps pre-existing subtrees that
  predate the pin. (2) Deleting a package's lock entry without its `node_modules/<pkg>/node_modules/*`
  children orphans them: the nested `type-is` survived, its nested `media-typer@0.3.0` did not, so
  `type-is` silently fell through to an incompatible root-hoisted `media-typer@1.1.0`, stopped
  recognising `multipart/form-data`, and multer skipped every request without complaint.
- **Lesson:** **Adding an override is not applying it, and pruning a lock entry prunes a subtree.
  Remove the WHOLE `node_modules/<pkg>(/…)*` family, run a real `npm install` (never
  `--package-lock-only`, which builds an ideal tree it never has to make work), then assert three
  things separately: the hoisted version moved, `validate-lock` reports `skew 0 new`, and the
  library still does its job.**
- **Guard:** `multer-field-limits.security.spec.ts` — it resolves multer from
  `@nestjs/platform-express`'s own directory and asserts >= 2.3.0, and it exercises a real
  multipart request end-to-end, which is what actually caught the orphan. `validate-lock` names the
  skew directly (`media-typer: found 1.1.0, wanted 0.3.0`), so it is a gate failure, not a mystery.

### L-028 · 2026-09-01 · tooling

- **Symptom:** a grouped dependency bump advertised a security update for a file-upload library. The
  PR title, changelog and lockfile diff all showed the new version — and every upload path kept
  running the old one, advisories intact.
- **Root cause:** a framework package declared that library at an **exact** version, so the hoisted
  copy stayed pinned there; the bump installed the new version only nested under one workspace,
  which nothing imports from. A version appearing in the lockfile says it was installed, never that
  it is what resolves at a call site.
- **Lesson:** **A dependency bump is proven by what RESOLVES at the call sites, not by the lockfile
  diff — for any security bump, check whether a parent's exact pin holds the hoisted copy, or the
  merge closes the ticket without closing the hole.**
- **Guard:** none yet — inspect the hoisted entry (and any parent's exact pin) before believing a
  security bump. The check that settles it is the **resolution**, which holds whatever the install
  state is:
  `node -e "console.log(require.resolve('<lib>',{paths:[require('path').dirname(require.resolve('<parent>/package.json'))]}))"`.
  ⚠️ A version string read out of `node_modules` is **not** independent confirmation: a tree that
  predates the bump's install reads the old version for the trivial reason that nothing installed
  the new one. Both this entry's author and its first reader made exactly that substitution within
  hours of filing it — **having written a rule makes you quicker, not slower, to accept a reading
  that confirms it.** Note the fix for this class is a root `overrides` pin, which [[L-012]]
  otherwise forbids: `overrides` is the only mechanism that beats a parent's exact pin on a
  **runtime** transitive, so state the exception in the PR or the next reader reverts it as a
  violation.

### L-009 · 2026-08-29 · tooling · #501

- **Symptom:** `npm run verify` printed a full jest pass after a 19-package dependency bump —
  without executing anything.
- **Root cause:** turbo replays cached task logs verbatim (summaries included), and its global
  hash missed lockfile-graph changes until #501.
- **Lesson:** **A test summary inside turbo output is not evidence tests ran — only the
  `Cached: N` line is; gate dependency-affecting changes with `--force` or direct `npx jest`.**
- **Guard:** `globalDependencies` in turbo.json (#501).

### L-010 · 2026-08-29 · tooling

- **Symptom:** one workspace's tests "failed" under verify while the same code passed everywhere
  else.
- **Root cause:** worker exhaustion under host load — the task exited 1 with **no test report at
  all**; nothing ever ran.
- **Lesson:** **A bare non-zero task exit with no test report is environmental — re-run that
  workspace directly before debugging; CI on clean runners is the authoritative gate.**
- **Guard:** none — judgment (triage: direct `npx jest`, then filtered turbo).

### L-012 · 2026-08-29 · tooling · #490 #494

- **Symptom:** removing a transitive pin as "redundant" would have broken every fresh install.
- **Root cause:** root `package.json` `overrides` leave no trace in the lockfile (npm ci cannot
  validate them), and peer graphs make some pins load-bearing in non-obvious ways.
- **Lesson:** **Pin in a workspace devDependency, never root `overrides` — and before removing
  any pin, re-resolve from manifests alone and prove it redundant.**
- **Guard:** `validate-lock` pre-install CI job (#490).

### L-011 · 2026-08-25 · tooling

- **Symptom:** phantom `X does not exist in type` errors on correct code; pre-push blocked.
- **Root cause:** the generated Prisma client was stale after pulling a schema change — and
  `npx prisma generate` writes to the **shared root** `node_modules`, so parallel worktrees
  clobber each other's client.
- **Lesson:** **Regenerate the Prisma client after any pull/checkout/rebase across a schema
  change, and expect all worktrees to share one generated client.**
- **Guard:** none — judgment.

### L-013 · 2026-08-17 · tooling

- **Symptom:** three of four CI jobs red on a dependency error the change never introduced.
- **Root cause:** the failure was at the _install_ step (registry flake), not the job's own
  command; separately, 0-step ~3 s "failures" while private are Actions billing, not the suite.
- **Lesson:** **Read which step failed before hunting a code fix — an install-step or 0-step red
  proves nothing about the change; rerun first.**
- **Guard:** none — judgment.

## testing

### L-025 · 2026-09-01 · testing

- **Symptom:** native Google Sign-In had been dead the whole time — the callback destructured a
  `default` export `expo-secure-store` does not have, so token storage threw on every device.
- **Root cause:** the throw sits inside a `!isWeb` branch. Every automated surface runs the web
  build, which takes the `localStorage` branch, so nothing ever executed the failing line. This is
  narrower than L-019: no native _module_ misbehaved — ordinary JS was shielded by a platform
  conditional.
- **Lesson:** **A `Platform`/`isWeb` branch is untested code unless something runs that platform.
  When you touch one side of such a branch, either exercise the other side or state plainly that
  it is unverified.**
- **Guard:** none — judgment. Grep `isWeb`/`Platform.OS` in any file a fix touches.

### L-014 · 2026-08-31 · testing · #562

- **Symptom:** two mutation probes survived a green suite.
- **Root cause:** one test pinned collaborator _state_ instead of _consultation_; another used
  `.not.toThrow()` in bare node, where the code path early-returns without `window`.
- **Lesson:** **Assert behavior through the collaborator (seed a real cooldown; make the fake
  host throw) — a totality test must run against a hostile host, not an absent one.**
- **Guard:** rewritten probes in the scan-engine suite.

### L-015 · 2026-07-19 · testing · #301

- **Symptom:** a list page 400'd for weeks ("Failed to load data") while its sibling tab worked.
- **Root cause:** pagination hardening added `@Min(1)` to a list DTO whose web callers send
  `limit: 0` as the fetch-all sentinel.
- **Lesson:** **Before tightening any list-DTO validation, grep `limit: 0` and other sentinel
  params across every client — hardening a contract means checking its consumers.**
- **Guard:** DTO regression specs (products, suppliers).

## deploy

### L-019 · 2026-08-31 · deploy · #565

- **Symptom:** the first real APK run crashed at launch, then hung on an eternal spinner.
- **Root cause:** a native module's major-version pin mismatch, plus the native keystore
  rejecting key charsets web storage always accepted — silent write failures.
- **Lesson:** **The first run on a real device is its own test surface — native modules validate
  versions and key charsets that web builds and bundlers never exercise.**
- **Guard:** key sanitizer + regression tests (#565).

### L-016 · 2026-08-29 · deploy · #475

- **Symptom:** (caught pre-merge) four endpoints would have 403'd for every tenant on deploy day.
- **Root cause:** a server-side `@RequireAddon` gate keyed on an addon that no shipped UI or SKU
  activation could grant.
- **Lesson:** **An entitlement gate with no way to GRANT it is a self-inflicted outage — for
  every new gate: which UI grants it, does activation write THAT key, what happens to existing
  users on deploy day?**
- **Guard:** gate checklist in feature-plan P4; legacy-key → SKU bridge.

### L-018 · 2026-08-25 · deploy · #435

- **Symptom:** a "successful" pre-deploy backup was a 0-byte file.
- **Root cause:** bare `railway run pg_dump` ran against the _linked_ service (not postgres) and
  exited 0 anyway.
- **Lesson:** **A backup isn't a backup until its size and content are validated — pin the
  service explicitly and check the artifact before depending on it.**
- **Guard:** backup-validation step in the ship routine.

### L-017 · 2026-08-18 · deploy

- **Symptom:** after a platform incident, the production API came back pointing at an empty
  database — four months of data gone with the container.
- **Root cause:** the postgres service had **no volume**; data lived on the container
  filesystem, and platform backups were plan-gated and off.
- **Lesson:** **A stateful service without a mounted volume is data loss waiting for the next
  restart — verify volume + external dumps before trusting any DB; restores stream through
  `psql`, never a raw client.**
- **Guard:** volume + PGDATA subdir + 2-hourly R2 dumps with an empty-dump guard.

## domain

### L-029 · 2026-09-01 · domain · #588

- **Symptom:** cancelling an order destroyed value three ways at once — it voided the invoice for
  goods already delivered, never returned the creation-time stock decrement, and its sibling
  `deleteOrder` skipped the regulated-ledger reversal both other invoice-destruction paths
  performed. All three had shipped green.
- **Root cause:** the conservation rules were built for the **edit** path and the **teardown**
  paths were simply never enrolled in them. Every signal each fix needed already sat in the same
  file — the delivered-qty clamp, the reversal call — and was not consulted. Nothing failed
  loudly, because a conservation law has no natural test: stock is only wrong much later, and
  nowhere near the cancel that caused it.
- **Lesson:** **When a codebase establishes an invariant on one path, enumerate every OTHER path
  that reaches the same state and enroll it explicitly — an invariant with a known exception is a
  bug with a scheduled date.** Search by the STATE being mutated (who else deletes an invoice, who
  else writes `order.status`), never by the feature name: the violating paths are the ones that
  never mention it.
- **Guard:** `orders.lifecycle-conservation.spec.ts` + its pins spec, 9 mutation probes. The same
  search immediately found two more instances, recorded not fixed: `routes.service.ts` has **five**
  `order.status` writers and only one runs the invoicing side effects (→ F11), and the customer
  purge is a **fourth** `reverseInvoiceEntries`-skipped hard delete — at four instances the answer
  is a shared guard, not a fourth point-fix. See [[L-008]] for why they stayed out of scope.

### L-030 · 2026-09-01 · domain · #588

- **Symptom:** the fix for the above introduced a NEW conservation bug. A DRAFT cancel correctly
  credited no stock (a draft never decremented) but still marked its line items CANCELLED, and
  `reopenOrder` re-decremented every marked line — so a draft's cancel→reopen round trip
  understated stock by the full order quantity.
- **Root cause:** the marker recording "this cancel gave stock back" was written unconditionally
  while the give-back itself was conditional. Two halves of one decision, written as two
  independent statements that happened to agree in the common case.
- **Lesson:** **When one write is the RECORD of another write having happened, bind both to a
  single named condition — not to two conditions that agree today.** A reader (and a reviewer) can
  check one boolean; they cannot check that two predicates are equivalent in every state.
- **Guard:** `REG-B64 (T7)` asserts a DRAFT cancel neither credits stock nor marks its lines;
  mutation probe 3 (make the mark unconditional) turns it red.

### L-022 · 2026-08-21 · domain · #393

- **Symptom:** 40% of a live buyer portal showed $0.00 — and the server would have billed it.
- **Root cause:** a FIXED per-unit promo scoped to ALL products, clamped at $0; the engine
  couldn't express the owner's real intent (buy-N-get-M), so it was faked with a dangerous
  approximation.
- **Lesson:** **Promotions apply to CUSTOMER orders only — and a pricing mechanic the engine
  cannot express will be misconfigured into one it can; build the real mechanic or block the
  config.**
- **Guard:** BUY_N_GET_M promotion type (#393); $0-exposure scan script.

### L-021 · 2026-08-12 · domain · #335

- **Symptom:** receiving a vendor bill 500'd (P2025) on real data despite green unit tests.
- **Root cause:** nested-created child rows carry NULL `tenantId` (nested writes bypass the
  tenant proxy's create-injection), so tenant-scoped child updates can never match them.
- **Lesson:** **In tenant-scoped services, write child rows THROUGH the parent's update — and
  audit any direct per-child write for the NULL-tenantId class.**
- **Guard:** single-helper pattern (`lineInventoryDelta`); class flagged for review.

### L-020 · 2026-07 · domain

- **Symptom:** invoices billed less than the agreed override price.
- **Root cause:** order→invoice conversion re-encoded a price override as
  `discount = originalPrice − unitPrice`, double-counting a discount already baked into the net
  `unitPrice`.
- **Lesson:** **A price override is net `unitPrice` + `originalPrice` (display) +
  `discount: 0` — `discount` is reserved for explicit operator discounts; never derive one from
  the other.**
- **Guard:** invoices spec "does NOT double-count a price override".

## security

### L-033 · 2026-09-01 · security

- **Symptom:** the version bump that "fixed" a High-severity DoS advisory left the vulnerability
  fully exploitable on every endpoint, even once the upgrade genuinely landed.
- **Root cause:** the upstream fix was a new **opt-in** option (`fieldArrayIndexLimit`), gated on
  `hasOwnProperty` and defaulting to `Infinity`. Nothing changed for a caller who upgraded and
  passed the same options as before. Two further layers had to be crossed before it worked at all:
  the framework's own closed `limits` type had no such key (a fresh object literal would not
  compile), and the framework's error mapper had never heard of the new error code, so the guard
  firing produced a 500 and a monitoring capture per request instead of a 400.
- **Lesson:** **Upgrading past a CVE is not mitigating it. Read the upstream fix and ask whether it
  is a new DEFAULT or a new OPTION — and if it is an option, trace it the whole way: does it
  typecheck, does the framework forward it, and what does the caller actually receive when it
  fires?**
- **Guard:** `multer-field-limits.security.spec.ts` asserts the rejection is a 400 end-to-end, and
  proves the guard is load-bearing by showing the same request succeeds without it.

### L-024 · 2026-09-01 · security

- **Symptom:** the obvious plan — restrict the one Maps key to the Android app — would have taken
  down server geocoding, address autocomplete and every browser map at once.
- **Root cause:** one key served three call origins (Android app, Railway server, browser), and a
  cloud API key accepts exactly **one** application-restriction type. The key had to stay
  unrestricted because the API deliberately re-serves it to browsers at runtime.
- **Lesson:** **One credential per call origin. Before restricting any shared key, enumerate who
  calls it and from where — a key with both a server and a browser origin can carry no application
  restriction at all until the callers are split.**
- **Guard:** three-key model recorded in memory `project_maps_key_architecture_2026-09-01`;
  `docs/plans/maps-key-split-note.md` is STALE and must not be followed verbatim.

### L-023 · 2026-07 · security

- **Symptom:** production login failed with "Invalid credentials" on correct passwords after a
  security pass.
- **Root cause:** the tenant-slug cookie was made `httpOnly`; the login page reads it via
  `document.cookie` to send `X-Tenant-Slug`, so tenant resolution fell back to a reserved host
  slug → null tenant → no user match.
- **Lesson:** **Before hardening any cookie/header/token, grep every consumer — a best practice
  applied against the architecture is an outage; prod-gated flags demand prod-mode
  verification.**
- **Guard:** non-httpOnly requirement documented at the cookie's writers/readers.
