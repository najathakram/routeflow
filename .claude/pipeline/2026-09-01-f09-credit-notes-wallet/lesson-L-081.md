- **Symptom:** wallet credit kept being consumed by WRITTEN_OFF (forgiven) invoices after the settle
  query had excluded VOID, and a fix at that query would still have missed the second door — the
  auto-apply path `send()`/`sendEmail()` reach — while a test whose mock injects the query result
  could not even see a `where`-only fix.
- **Root cause:** the guard lived at one call site's query instead of at the money write; four
  hand-rolled status lists (manual apply, settle, delivery payments, the advance wallet) had drifted
  apart, and PAID had to stay in the settle set because the same loop shrinks excess credit.
- **Lesson:** **gate a money write inside the primitive that performs it, on the row it just read
  (an exclude-list, so a fixture without the field still writes) — sibling primitives and
  result-injecting mocks bypass a where-only fix; and keep every status set in one named module with
  the reason each differs written beside it.**
- **Guard:** REG-B67 T1/T2/T5 (apply-side, incl. the auto-apply door) and REG-B66 T6/T7/T9–T11 in
  `apps/api/src/credit-notes/credit-notes.wallet-integrity.spec.ts`; the pins file (T3/T3b) proves
  PAID/WRITTEN_OFF still shrink; `apps/api/src/invoices/invoice-status-sets.ts` is the one home.
